## Environment

### Cassandra

As development purpose, you may want to install cassandra locally, to do that you check this [page](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) to install it properly. From stackoverflow I could also get a reading on how to start using [time series data modeling un cassandra](http://patrickmcfadin.com/2014/02/05/getting-started-with-time-series-data-modeling/) that I will employ on next commits, if it is required!
